 * A program that aids players of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt video game
 * with inventory management and trading in-game. It is not a mod.
 * Users enter the ingredient they are wondering whether they should keep
 * or sell, and the program returns with an answer, based on a database of
 * information about what alchemy & crafting recipes require each ingredient.
 * Users also keep the app up to date on which recipes they have created so far
 * so that the app can tell them an up-to-date grocery list of needed and
 * not-needed recipe ingredients.
